I study biology at the University of York. In my spare time I read quite a few [books](/post/2019/02/04/read-books/) and am often working on side projects which I publish on [this blog] (/). This website is built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and uses the XMin theme made by the prolific [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/).
